# DALIChat Frontend

This repository was designed and developed by [Adam McQuilkin '22](https://github.com/ajmcquilkin), and is intended to teach new DALI lab members the basics of MERN-stack Javascript web development as well as current best practices. To suggest changes to this repository, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/dali-lab/dalichat-frontend/issues) or create a pull request [here](https://github.com/dali-lab/dalichat-frontend/pulls).

## Overview

This repository is intended to accompany the DALI new developer onboarding course, and is organized into learning sections. Each learning section is represented in its own branch, and will contain prompts to expand on concepts from class lessons.

While these prompts may often be challenging, you are **_strongly discouraged_** from looking ahead to copy code from a future branch. While we can't explicitly prevent you from looking ahead within the branches, this class is both **not graded** and for your own personal benefit as a member of the lab. To succeed in the DALI lab requires that you understand the concepts this class covers, and by skipping ahead you are merely cheating yourself of the concepts and best practices this repository is intended to convey.

This being said, you are **highly encouraged** to work together with the members of your class and the members of the lab to discuss and develop solutions for the prompts within this repository. This will give you a feel for what working in the DALI lab entails and will only benefit you in the future.

## Outline

As mentioned above, this repository contains branches accompanying each lesson from the DALI developer onboarding class. Below is an ordered list of branches contained within this repository and the concepts they cover.

1. `starter`
